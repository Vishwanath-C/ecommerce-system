    Edit `src/main/resources/application.properties` and add the following:

    ```properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/ecommerce_db
    spring.datasource.username=root
    spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
    spring.jpa.show-sql=true

3. Run the backend
  ```bash
  ./gradlew bootRun

4: Verify backend
  ```Open a browser or Postman and check:
    http://localhost:8080

2. Frontend (React / Vite)

Step 1: Navigate to the frontend folder
cd frontend

Step 2: Install dependencies
npm install

Step 3: Start the development server
```npm run dev

Step 4: Verify frontend
```Open a browser and visit:
http://localhost:5173

Step 5 (Optional): Build for production
```npm run build```

- The compiled files will be in the dist/ folder.
- You can serve them via Spring Boot by copying them to:
    backend/src/main/resources/static/
